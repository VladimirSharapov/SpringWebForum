    This project is a simple web forum. I created it just to
    demonstrate my programming skills to potential employers.

    Here is short description: ( for more detailed description please reade README.md or

    Front-end: jsp, bootstrap, jquery
    Back-end: Spring, Hibernate
    DB: MySQL and H2(for testing) were used while developing, but the project is database independent.
